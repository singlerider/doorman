# doorman
A Twilio app that sends a tone after receiving password input from a user.

A user punches a code for a gate/door key that is intended to call a second user's phone. A system like this waits for a key to be pressed to give a signal to open/unlock the gate/door. If the password is correct, the Twilio number will press the key that unlocks the door, giving the first user access to the facility.
